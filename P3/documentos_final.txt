616 | information algebra phase report languagestructure group codasyl development committee | this report represents the results of thefirst phase of the work of the language structure group.  the goal of this work is to arrive at a properstructure for a machine-independent problem-defining language, at the systems level of data processing.  thereport is based, for the most part, on a mathematical model called "an information algebra" developed primarilyby r. bosak.  it is hoped that this report will be read (a) with avid interest by programming languagedesigners and implementors, and all those interested in developing a theoretical approach to dataprocessing; (b) with interest and understanding by professional programmers and systems analysts; and (c)with appreciation by the businessman-analyst-manager.  the authors have not attempted an exhaustive discoursein this report.  rather, they have tried to present a philosophy to the professional people who are vitallyconcerned with providing a working language for the systems analyst's use.  they trust that the ideasin this report will stimulate others to think along similar lines.  questions and comments will be welcomed,and can be addressed to any of the members of the language structure group:  robert bosak, systemdevelopment corporation;  richard f. clippinger, honeywell edp division;  carey dobbs, remington randunivac division;  roy goldfinger (chairman), ibm corporation;  renee b. jasper, navy management office; william keating, national cash register;  george kendrick, general electric company;  jean e. sammet, ibm corporation.

724 | profile programmer | synopsis: 549 members of the acm participatedin a study concerned primarily with the attitudes of programmers toward their careers and jobs.  a veryhigh percentage of programmers have apparently entered their careers by accident; it has proven a happychoice for most and they expect to remain in the field during the next five years.  their principaljob satisfactions relate to the nature of their work, and mostfind their jobs offer high level of professionalinterest and good working conditions.  salary and advancement prospects, however,are not assatisfactory.  more than half report a positive attitude toward programmers and programming on the partof their organizations.  turnover among themselves is attributed primarily to poor management-salary isseen as the principal motivating factor in turnover among other programmers.  nature of the work offeredand salary are principal determinants in accepting a new job.  programmers are less mobile than expected. programmers tend to see their colleagues in a favorable light, on the whole.  personalities seem tovary with function, systems programmers differing from applications programmers.  four principal problemsfor programming in the immediate future are listed by participants: languages, personnel, various specificapplications and techniques, and building programming as a profession.

1290 | transparent mode control procedure datacommunication american standard code information interchange tutorial | this paper gives the considerations of taskgroup x3.3.4 in the area of transparent-mode data communication control philosophy.  the appearance of thispaper was forecast (underthe name of "second-level control") in the earlier tutorial paper, "control proceduresfor data communications," task group document x3.3.4.44, dated may 1964.  the present paper elaboratesupon solutions to the problems of transparency to the basic ascii communication control charactersas outlined in the previous paper mentioned above.  moreover, it goes on to cover the additional control problemsof handling material such as off line encrypted data or non-ascii codes by means of systems providingcomplete character transparency.  it does not cover concepts of transparency in which the normal characterstructure or modulation rate of a system may be abandoned.  in conjunction with the earlier tutorialpaper, this paper is expected to lead to a proposal for stand ardizationof data communication control proceduresusing the american stand ard code for information interchange.

1361 | rectangular hole twelve row punchedcards proposed american standard
1362 | code extension ascii asa tutorial | the american standard code for informationinterchange (ascii) contains a number of control characters associated with the principle of code extension,that is, with the representation of information which cannot be directly represented by means of the charactersin the code.  the manner of use of these characters has not previously been completely described. this paper presents a set of mutually consistent philosophies regarding code extension applications,and suggests a corollary set of doctrines for the application of the code extension characters.  distinctionsare drawn between code extension and such other concepts as "graphic substitution" or "syntacticrepresentation" which are often used to meet similar requirements.  also covered are certain topics whichare not truly concerned with code extension but which are often linked with it in discussion on code applications. the material in this paper is equally applicable in principle to the (proposed) iso international7-bit code for information interchange.
